# Development
-----------------------------------
### -Week 1-
----------------
-List of tasks I want to achieve by the end of this working week-
- [x] Download the libraries and frameworks I want to use
- [x] make sure I can get them working properly
- [ ] Try out test examples for these libraries such as:
 - accessing and opening the MacBook camera
 
- beginning to develop the facial detection program

- using the dlib library to find and detect facial features/structures

- figuring out the object I want to use to test the filter

### -Week 2-
----------------
-Summary-

As I began working on my facial filter, I realized it was much more difficult than I thought. I first struggled with even getting the project to compile. There were a lot of errors I was getting that I had no clue how to fix, so I had to do a lot of research into pretty much all the addons and what they did. This helped me understand what addons I exactly needed to include in my final project. Accessing the camera however, was something I did manage to make a bit of progress on, since I found an OF example that did just that. So for this week I completed how to implement the addons on OpenFrameworks. However, if the entirity of the project seems too difficult to complete, I've decided I want to create my rendition of Pac-Man, since I can work somewhat similarly to how the OF Snake project functioned. This is my plan in case I am unable to develop my face filter program.

-Progress Made This Week-
- found example to base video capturing on
- researched more on implementing face filters in cpp
- set up files for video capture

-List of tasks I want to achieve by the end of this working week-
- [ ] Access the Camera using ofxAVFVideoRecorder
- [ ] Understand code that I am implementing from example project
- [ ] Further research into face filter development in cpp.
- [ ] Attempt to use dlib
